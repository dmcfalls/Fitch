# Automated Fitch Proof Generator

Given a set of premises and a desired result in propositional logic, returns a full proof from the premises to the result if it exists.

Models finding a proof as a search problem and solves using Uniform Cost Search. So far, it is capable of finding proofs for relatively simple results, but takes a very long time to compute more difficult results.

Uses a generic implementation of UCS and PriorityQueue.
